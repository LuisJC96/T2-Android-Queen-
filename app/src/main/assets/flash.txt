Flash! Ah-ah
Savior of the universe
Flash! Ah-ah
He'll save everyone of us
Flash! Ah-ah
He's a miracle
Flash! Ah-ah
King of the impossible
He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He saves with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman
Every child, it's the mighty Flash
(What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching?
(Open fire! All weapons!)
(Dispatch war rocket Ajax to bring back his body)
Flash! Ah-ah
(Gordon's alive!)
Flash! Ah-ah
He'll save every one of us
Just a man with a man's courage
You know he's nothing but a man
And he can never fail
No one but the pure at heart
May find the Golden Grail
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Flash
